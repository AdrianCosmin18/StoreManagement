# Store Management

I created an app which presents concepts specific to OOP in Java combined with MySQL. 
I created services that use JDBC to store the data in a database.
The app simulates an online store where you cand create an account and do online shopping.

After you get logged, you can do several things like:
  * see all products and their info
  * add products in cart
  * see the content of the cart
  * delete a product from cart
  * place order

There is also the option to be an admin and you can perform operations specific to an admin, as exemple:
  * see the last placed order
  * best sold product
  * add a new product for customers
  * modify a client
